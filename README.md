# Academic Navigator 

The project's vision is to create a user-friendly application that helps students navigate their college course selection process. My goal is to provide various tools and features that will make the experience more convenient and personalized for the student. Some features of the project include:
<br>
•I successfully parsed data from the Cornell class roster API, which allowed us to provide students with the most up-to-date information on available courses.
<br>
•I implemented a feature that allows students to sort classes based on their preferred time frames, making it easier for them to create a schedule that works for them. For instance, the student can ask the engine to output classes occuring at certain time frame such as the morning.
<br>
•I added a GPA calculator to our application, which will help students monitor their academic progress throughout their college years.
<br>
•I gave students the ability to go back and fix their input or quit the application at any time, ensuring that their experience with the application is as stress-free and flexible as possible.
